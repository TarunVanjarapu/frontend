                   <h1>PAGANI AUTOMOBILES</h1>
                   <P>Horacio Pagani, who formerly created and managed Lamborghini's composites department,
                    founded Pagani Composite Research in 1988. This new company worked with Lamborghini 
                    on numerous projects, including the restyling of the Lamborghini Countach 25th Anniversary 
                    Edition, the Lamborghini LM002, the P140 design concept, and the Diablo. In the late 1980s,
                    Pagani began designing his own car, then referred to as the "C8 Project". Pagani planned to 
                    rename the C8 the "Fangio F1" to honour his friend, the Argentine five-time Formula One champion,
                    Juan Manuel Fangio.In 1991, Pagani established Modena Design to meet the increasing demand for his design, 
                    engineering, and prototyping services. In 1992, he began construction of a Fangio F1 prototype, and by 1993, 
                    the car was being tested at the Dallara wind tunnel with positive results. In 1994, Mercedes-Benz agreed to 
                    supply Pagani with V12 engines. The cost of these cars are at a total of 2.3 million dollars.</P>
